1.Problem Statement
A lot of people, including me, sometimes don’t know if the passwords we make are actually strong enough. Many users end up using simple passwords because they are easy to remember, but they can also be cracked easily. So in this project, I decided to make a small tool that can check the strength of a password and tell the user if it is weak, medium, or strong.

2.Scope of the Project
This is a simple Python project made using Tkinter. The main goal is just to take a password from the user, check a few things like its length, whether it has capital/lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols, and then show how strong the password is.
The project is only focused on checking strength. It does not save passwords or do anything advanced. The idea is to keep it simple and easy for beginners.

3.Target Users
The tool can be useful for:
Students and normal users who want to create better passwords.
 ,People who are not sure if their password is safe.
 ,Anyone who wants a quick and easy offline password checker.

4.High-Level Features
Very simple Tkinter-based interface
 ,User can type any password to check
 ,Checks password using basic rules (length, letters, digits, symbols)
 ,Shows output as Weak, Medium, or Strong
 ,Helps users understand how to make a better password
